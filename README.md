# Structure

Main project contains pages, components, features and utils.

- There are several pages. Some of them have all of the code for rendering inside (like ErrorPage), some contains child components (like dashboard).
- Pages and components folders have index.js inside. We use it for get all of the files and export as object, so we can easy import multiple components in one line like this: `import { FormRow, FormRowSelect } from "../../components"`

  - local storage : handle store, get and remove the user info in local storage.
